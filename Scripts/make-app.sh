# The application icon, if there is one to build it from.
#
# The artwork is deliberately not in the repository: drop an icon.png in the
# root and it is picked up, leave it out and the app gets the generic icon.
#
# Two formats, because macOS 26 changed what an app icon is. Before it, the
# system drew the .icns as given. On 26 it draws its own rounded plate and sets
# a plain .icns *inside* it — the app ends up as a small picture in a white box,
# and no amount of adjusting the margins in the artwork changes it, because the
# system re-fits whatever it is handed. The new format inverts that: the artwork
# is the plate, and the system rounds and shades it. It is an Icon Composer
# document, which is a directory holding one JSON file and the images, so it can
# be written here rather than drawn in the app.
#
# actool emits both — Assets.car for 26 and an .icns for everything older — and
# needs a full Xcode. Without one, make-icon.swift builds the .icns by itself and
# the icon is the legacy one, which is what that machine would show anyway.

# rather than the command line tools, so a machine without it still gets a
